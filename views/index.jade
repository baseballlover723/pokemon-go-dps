            //p This site will soon update every 30 minutes from the latest game master file from <a href="https://github.com/BrunnerLivio/pokemongo-game-master">https://github.com/BrunnerLivio/pokemongo-game-master</a>
            p This is the equation for Fast & Charge DPS. It is the dps you would expect if you used your charge move as fast as possible, using your fast move when you couldn't use your charge move. fm is data from the fast move and cm is data from the charge move. Note you add 0.5 seconds for the charge move, since you have to hold for 0.5 seconds to activate it

            p.small-margin This is the equation for the Offensive Rating. Note it includes 7 IVs each for stamina, attack and defense. The theory behind this is that attack scales linearly with how much damage you do per hit, and DPS, and stamina and defense scale linearly with how long you live, increasing the amount of damage you can do due to living longer. <strong>Note this value is divided by 100,000</strong> to make it easier to visually compare against other Offensive Ratings, you shouldn't directly compare the Offensive Rating with any other stat, since the real offensive rating is 100,000 bigger than shown

            p Note, if you want to search for a specific pokemon number, you can add an additional '#' at the end to signal the end of the number. ex) '#13#' will show Weedle (#13) and not Eevee (#133) or Gyaradoes (#130)
            p You can also use "|" to search for multiple terms. ex) if you want to compare Caterpie (#10) and Weedle (#13) you can type '#13#|#10#', to match results for both of them
            p Note: Critical strikes are currently not implemented in the game yet, all DPS and DPS related values are now calculated assuming no critical strikes
            p To use the Gym Defenders feature, select a pokemon that you want to consider attacking from the dropdown box below (another one will pop up for you to add more), you'll see the pokemon type modifiers table update to reflect the current modifier multiplier for a move of each type. The main table below will update all of its DPS values to use the damage of the move multiplied by the moves type modifier. You can uncheck one of the boxes to temporarily not include that pokemon in the calculation or the checkbox under Gym Defenders to include or omit all the pokemon defenders.
