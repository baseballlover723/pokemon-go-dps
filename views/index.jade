            p Is my data wrong or did the game just have an update? Update this wiki and then <button id='refresh'>force this site to reload its data from the wiki.</button> (It takes a few minutes to update, limited to once per hour) <strong>PLEASE DO NOT RELOAD THE DATA</strong> unless you have made changes to the wiki. If this is pressed too much I will be forced to remove this button, and this website will only update once a day!

    p Note, if you want to search for a specific pokemon number, you can add an additional '#' at the end to signal the end of the number. ex) '#13#' will show Weedle (#13) and not Eevee (#133) or Gyaradoes (#130)
    p You can also use "|" to search for multiple terms. ex) if you want to compare Caterpie (#10) and Weedle (#13) you can type '#13#|#10#', to match results for both of them
