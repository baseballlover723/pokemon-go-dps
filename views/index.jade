      //p This site will soon update every 30 minutes from the latest game master file from <a href="https://github.com/BrunnerLivio/pokemongo-game-master">https://github.com/BrunnerLivio/pokemongo-game-master</a>
      p.deprecation-notice Deprecation Notice:
      p I run this website on a free service and am essentially limited to only being able to run 1 app 24/7. Since I'm no longer actively working on this site, and there aren't a ton of users on this site, ff I end up making another site that needs to run 24/7, I will transfer this website to a static website at a different url (it will no longer auto-update). This is probably a few months away, as I don't plan to have any side projects that would run 24/7 in the near future. To be clear, this website is not going away anytime soon, and be in the same state its currently in for the foreseeable future.
      //p Is my data wrong or did the game just have an update? Update this wiki and then <button id='refresh'>force this site to reload its data from the wiki.</button> (It takes a few minutes to update, limited to once per hour) <strong>PLEASE DO NOT RELOAD THE DATA</strong> unless you have made changes to the wiki. If this is pressed too much I will be forced to remove this button, and this website will only update once a day!

      p.small-margin This is the equation for the Offensive Rating. Note it includes 7 IVs each for stamina, attack and defense. The theory behind this is that attack scales linearly with how much damage you do per hit, and DPS, and stamina and defense scale linearly with how long you live, increasing the amount of damage you can do due to living longer. <strong>Note this value is divided by 100,000</strong> to make it easier to visually compare against other Offensive Ratings, you shouldn't directly compare the Offensive Rating with any other stat, since the real offensive rating is 100,000 bigger than shown

      p Note, if you want to search for a specific pokemon number, you can add an additional '#' at the end to signal the end of the number. ex) '#13#' will show Weedle (#13) and not Eevee (#133) or Gyaradoes (#130)
      p You can also use "|" to search for multiple terms. ex) if you want to compare Caterpie (#10) and Weedle (#13) you can type '#13#|#10#', to match results for both of them
      p Note: Critical strikes are currently not implemented in the game yet, all DPS and DPS related values are now calculated assuming no critical strikes
      p To use the Gym Defenders feature, select a pokemon that you want to consider attacking from the dropdown box below (another one will pop up for you to add more), you'll see the pokemon type modifiers table update to reflect the current modifier multiplier for a move of each type. The main table below will update all of its DPS values to use the damage of the move multiplied by the moves type modifier. You can uncheck one of the boxes to temporarily not include that pokemon in the calculation or the checkbox under Gym Defenders to include or omit all the pokemon defenders.
